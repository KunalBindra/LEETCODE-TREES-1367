# LEETCODE-TREES-1367
Your code defines a solution to check whether a linked list is a sub-path of a binary tree. Here’s a dry run explanation for the `isSubPath` function.

## Functions Overview:
1. **CBT(ListNode head, TreeNode root)**:
   - This function checks whether a linked list starting at `head` is a path in the binary tree starting at `root`.
   - If the linked list (`head`) is `null`, it means you've successfully found the path, so return `true`.
   - If the binary tree node (`root`) is `null`, it means you can't continue, so return `false`.
   - Check if the current linked list node (`head.val`) matches the current tree node (`root.val`).
   - If they match, recursively check either the left or right child of the tree (`root.left` or `root.right`) with the next node in the list (`head.next`).

2. **isSubPath(ListNode head, TreeNode root)**:
   - This is the main function that checks whether the linked list is a sub-path starting from any node in the binary tree.
   - If the binary tree (`root`) is `null`, return `false` (no path is possible).
   - Check if the linked list is a sub-path starting from the current tree node (`CBT(head, root)`), or if the list is a sub-path starting from the left or right child of the current tree node (`isSubPath(head, root.left)` or `isSubPath(head, root.right)`).

### Dry Run:

Consider the following case:

- **Linked List**: 1 → 2 → 3
- **Binary Tree**:
    ```
        1
       / \
      4   2
         / \
        3   6
    ```

1. **isSubPath(head=1, root=1)**:
   - Call `CBT(head=1, root=1)` since `head.val == root.val`.
   - Move to the next linked list node and check the left and right child of the current root.

2. **CBT(head=2, root.left=null)**:
   - Left child is `null`, so return `false`.

3. **CBT(head=2, root.right=2)**:
   - Call `CBT(head=2, root.right=2)` since `head.val == root.val`.
   - Move to the next linked list node and check the left and right child of the current root.

4. **CBT(head=3, root.left=3)**:
   - Call `CBT(head=3, root.left=3)` since `head.val == root.val`.
   - Move to the next linked list node.

5. **CBT(head=null, root=3)**:
   - The linked list is `null`, so return `true` (we've successfully matched the entire linked list).

Thus, the linked list is found to be a sub-path in the binary tree.

The solution works recursively and checks all potential sub-paths in the binary tree starting from any node, and the `CBT` function checks whether the list is a path starting from the current node.

### Improvements:
- You may want to add a null check in the `CBT` function to ensure that both `head` and `root` are not `null` before accessing their values.
